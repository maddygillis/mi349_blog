        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>            Hi! My name is Maddy and I am a Senior at Michigan State University studying Supply Chain with a minor in Information Technology. I have only coded previously in an intro to Python coding class. I did not enjoy it. BUT(!) taking MI 349 has made me change my mind on coding!! I have really enjoyed this class so far and surprisingly have enjoyed coding too. I listed some random facts about myself below:
    
            <ul>
                <li>I have a dog named Lexie (pic of her is below)</li>
                <li>RomCom movies are my favorite (one of the best is "Crazy, Stupid, Love" in my opinion)</li>
                <li>I want to get a cat next year and I can't decide on the best cat name</li>
            </ul>
