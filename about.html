        <p>            Hi! My name is Maddy and I am a Senior at Michigan State University studying Supply Chain with a minor in Information Technology. I have only coded previously in an intro to Python coding class. I did not enjoy it. BUT(!) taking MI 349 has made me change my mind on coding!! I have really enjoyed this class so far and surprisingly have enjoyed coding too.

                <li>RomCom movies are my favorite (one of the best is "Crazy, Stupid, Love" in my opinion)</li>
                <li>I want to get a cat next year and I can't decide on the best cat name</li>

            <p>I'm not sure what else to write about in this section, so I am just going to do a little recap of what is going on this week. Our old roommate is visiting from CHicago today and I am VERY excited. We haven't seen each other for a month, so it will be nice to catch up. This weekend, we have the football game so we are going to rama which is always fun. And then Saturday night, my family and I are celebrating my sister's birthday. We are going to cook pizzas and have a bonfire, I am also super excited for that. My brother, sister and I are all coming hoem for the little celebration so it will be really nice to have the fam all back together at our house. I have homework due monday so I will probaly spend Sunday working on that and hanging out with my family, so that will be the rest of my weekend! </p>
