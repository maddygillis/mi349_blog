        Covid has had huge impacts on travel and tourism all over the world. As borders are starting to open, visiting new places is still completely different than it was pre-pandemic. We also find that the rules and restrictions are constantly changing and it is hard to keep up with the different policies. Having a set place to find the up-to-date rules on different places would be a huge help for those looking to travel in today's environment. 

        Places have different rules on requiring masks, proof of negative covid test, or still not being able to visit nonessential businesses. Having this information condensed onto one website would be an immense help when booking travel plans. The demand to easily compare different cities, states, or countries has grown and there is nowhere that currently satisfies the customer's need.

    <h3>Blog topic 2</h3>

    <p>
        I am starting this blog to document my experiences while traveling this summer and create a place for advice while traveling with covid. Traveling internationally has always been a bucket list item to do for me, and I have been looking forward to the experience for a long time. With the current environment, I know that traveling will be looking different than in previous years. I want to find a website where group sourcing is used to get up-to-date information on travel experiences in different places. It would be great if people could easily enter information on where they were, what they did, and how it went. It would also be great to pull information from government sites to also see the current rules and regulations. Having information from both people and government sites would help give a holistic view of how the experience will actually be. 
        
        For example, in Michigan, there is no more mask mandate. So if you were traveling to Michigan state you might think that there wouldn't be a requirement for masks, but on campus, they are required indoors. Having people enter this information would allow for both aspects of this rule to be explored on a single website
